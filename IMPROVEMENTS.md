# Improvements
* ### `Search emails by either email sender, reciever or some subject text`
  * I think a searchable email system is neccessary if we are to have a large amount of emails

* ### `Bookmark certain emails and store them in a separate container`
  * We should be able to store our bookmarked email into separate section away from all the emails

* ### `Option to organize emails by their category`
  * Private emails, work related emails and such should be in separate section of our email archiver
